<h3>Build files</h3>

<p>Build files are files that end's with **.build** and tells RBT how to build the module, these modules will be stored in a temp folder until the target file compiles them all into a single executable</p>

<hr>

<h4>Commands</h4>

<div id="Code">
    <p>Name = String</p>
</div>
<p>The name of the build, this will also be the name for the module</p>

<div id="Code">
    <p>EntryFile = String</p>
</div>
<p>The source code file that the compiler should compile first, should link other files needed</p>

<div id="Code">
    <p>PublicDependencies = [String Array]</p>
</div>
<p>All dependencies within this array will be used, these dependencies are from the runtime and can only import code from the /Public directory. Once imported, they can be included in your C++ project as if they are in the same directory</p>

<div id="Code">
    <p>PrivateDependencies = [String Array]</p>
</div>
<p>All dependencies within this array will be used, these dependencies are from the runtime and can only import code from the /Private directory. Once imported, they can be included in your C++ project as if they are in the same directory</p>

<div id="Code">
    <p>ThirdPartyDepend = [String Array]</p>
    </div>
    <p>Build and link 3rd party applications</p>

<div id="Code">
    <p>PrecompileUnix = String</p>
</div>
<p>If compiling on unix, and a precompiled build is already created, copy that file and paste it's contents into the temp directory for the target to compile. This is especially useful for Third Party software, as those can easily be used and doesn't require constant updates unless needed. The string points to the directory within the source code that contains the precompiled build</p>
